/**
 * Shared owner of ~/.leaf/state.json.
 *
 * Three services (systemPrompt, theme, language) each persist a single key
 * into the same state file. Left to themselves they each did an independent
 * read-whole-file → merge one key → write-whole-file, with no lock and a
 * non-atomic write — so a `theme:setActive` overlapping a `systemPrompt`
 * seed-write could drop one change or leave a half-written, unparseable file.
 *
 * This module serialises every access through a single promise chain (an
 * async mutex) and writes atomically via a temp file + rename, so concurrent
 * callers can't interleave or corrupt the file. Each service still validates
 * the raw object against its own Zod schema; the `.catchall()` on those
 * schemas means unknown keys (other services' values) survive round-trips.
