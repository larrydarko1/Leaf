# Contributing to Leaf

Thank you for considering contributing to Leaf! This is a desktop note-taking application built with Electron and Vue 3.

## Platform support

Leaf targets **macOS and Linux only**, and it is developed on those two as well.

The reason is honesty about testing: the maintainer has no Windows machine, and a platform nobody
can run is a platform whose bugs get found by users instead of by CI. Shipping an installer implies
a promise to test it. Windows path semantics were also the source of the only separator-handling
code in the vault layer — code that was subtly wrong on Linux, where a backslash is a legal filename
character rather than a separator.

Practically, this means:

- `package.json` declares `"os": ["darwin", "linux"]`, so `npm install` on Windows fails fast with a
  clear message rather than part-way through a build
- There is no `build:win` script and no Windows entry in the release matrix
- Treat path separators as `/`. Don't reintroduce `\` handling
- Releases before this change still have a Windows `.exe` attached; those downloads stay up, they
  just won't get new versions

WSL is not tested either, but it is Linux — if it works there, it works.

## Development Setup

1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Clone your fork**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/larrydarko1/leaf.git
    cd leaf
    ```
3. **Install dependencies**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
4. **Start the development environment**
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

This will launch the Electron app with hot reload enabled.

## Project Structure

See the [README](../README.md#project-structure) for the full project structure tree.

Key conventions:

- **Main process** (`src/main/`) — Electron backend. Business logic lives in `services/`, shared constants in `lib/`
- **Preload** (`src/preload/`) — Secure IPC bridge. All renderer↔main communication goes through here
- **Renderer** (`src/renderer/`) — Vue 3 frontend. Components in `components/`, reusable logic in `composables/` (grouped by domain: `ai/`, `editor/`, `drawing/`, `vault/`, `ui/`)
- **Tests** (`tests/`) — Mirrors the `src/` structure (`tests/main/`, `tests/renderer/`)

## How to Contribute

### Branching

Leaf is trunk-based: `main` is the only long-lived branch, and everything else is a short-lived
branch off it that gets squash-merged and deleted. Branch names carry the same type prefix as the
commits — `feat/`, `fix/` or `chore/`:

```sh
git switch -c feat/markdown-table-shortcut
```

Keep them short-lived — hours to days, ideally under a week. A branch that stays open for weeks
diverges far enough from `main` that merging it stops being a merge and starts being a rewrite.

`main` is always deployable, so nothing half-working lands on it. That is not a style preference
here: any green commit on `main` whose `package.json` version is untagged will be tagged, built and
published by `release.yml`.

### Commit messages

Commits follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/), enforced locally by the
husky `commit-msg` hook. Allowed types are listed with their meanings in `commitlint.config.js`.

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>          required, imperative mood, 200 chars max

<body>                              optional, why not what, wrap at 400 chars
```

- **Subject** — title ("added table shortcut, etc")
- **Scope** — optional, the area touched: `feat(editor):`, `fix(vault):`. Skip it when it isn't obvious
- **Body** — explain _why_, especially trade-offs and approaches you rejected. The diff already shows _what_. Leave it blank only for genuinely trivial changes

Commits inside your branch can be messy — `wip`, fixups, whatever you need. They get squashed away.
Only the hook's format rule has to pass on each one.

### Pull requests

**The PR title has to be a valid conventional commit.** Squash-merge discards the branch's individual
subjects and uses the PR title as the commit that lands on `main` — so the title is the only thing
history keeps. `pr-title.yml` lints it on every edit, so a wrong title is a red check rather than a
surprise at merge time.

```
feat(editor): added markdown table shortcut     ✅
Added markdown table shortcut                   ❌
```

Merging:

- **Squash and merge only.** Not rebase-and-merge, not a merge commit — `main` stays linear
- **Delete the branch** afterwards
- Full CI has to be green first
- Never force-push `main`, or any branch someone else has pulled

Don't bump the version in a feature PR — see [Releases](#releases) below.

### Before Submitting a PR

One command runs the exact gate list CI runs:

```sh
npm run ci:check
```

That is `npm audit` (production deps, high and above) → lint → format check → stylelint → tests with
coverage → build. Running it locally first is the difference between one push and six.

If lint or formatting fails, auto-fix with:

```sh
npm run lint:fix
npm run format
npm run stylelint:fix
```

CI builds the app but never launches it, so `npm run dev` and clicking through your change is still
worth doing — a broken IPC call or a component that fails to mount passes every check above.

### Local hooks

[husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) installs the hooks automatically via the `prepare` script,
so `npm install` is all the setup there is. They are the first line of defence before CI:

| Hook         | Runs                                                | On                         |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `pre-commit` | `lint-staged` → `eslint --fix` + `prettier --write` | `*.ts`, `*.vue`            |
|              | `stylelint --fix`                                   | `*.scss`, `*.vue`          |
|              | `prettier --write`                                  | `*.scss`, `*.json`, `*.md` |
| `commit-msg` | `commitlint`                                        | the commit message         |

Because these only touch staged files, they are fast but partial — they are not a substitute for
`npm run ci:check`, which is what CI actually runs.

## Testing

[Vitest](https://vitest.dev) is the only test runner — main process, renderer, composables and Vue
components all go through it. Vue components mount with
[Vue Test Utils](https://test-utils.vuejs.org/) under `jsdom`.

### Where tests live

Tests mirror `src/` under `tests/`. That is the pattern this project picked — don't co-locate
`__tests__/` folders alongside source:

```
src/main/lib/paths.ts            →  tests/main/paths.test.ts
src/renderer/composables/vault/  →  tests/renderer/composables/vault/
src/schemas/                     →  tests/schemas/
```

- The `.test.ts` suffix is what Vitest actually discovers — the folder is convention, the suffix is the mechanism
- Shared helpers live in `tests/renderer/test-utils`, importable as `@test-utils` (aliased in `vitest.config.ts` alongside `@/main`, `@/renderer`, `@/schemas`, `@/preload`)
- **Every test file ends in `.test.ts`.** Not `.spec.ts` — Vitest is configured to match `.test.ts`, so a `.spec.ts` is picked up by no runner at all. It stops running while still looking like a test, which is the worst of both

### What to test, in priority order

1. **Security-relevant functions** — vault path resolution, anything sanitising note content before it reaches the DOM, anything validating IPC payloads
2. **Pure utilities** — the cheapest tests you will ever write
3. **Main-process service logic** — `src/main/services/`
4. **Composables** — state, transforms, side effects
5. **Components** — conditional rendering, emitted events, form validation, and accessibility: semantic elements over click-handling `<div>`s, ARIA where semantics aren't enough, keyboard paths (Tab order, Enter/Space, Esc to close), and focus moving into a modal and back to its trigger

**Rule of thumb: if it has an `if`, a loop, or a transform, it gets a test.**

**Test the negative cases.** Wrong types, boundary conditions, empty and malformed input, and — because
this app reads and writes arbitrary files — path traversal attempts. A vault function tested only on
`notes/todo.md` is untested against `../../.ssh/id_rsa`.

### Test behaviour, not implementation

Assert what a component does — what renders, what it emits, what a function returns — not how it does
it internally. Tests that reach into private state break during refactors without catching real bugs.

The mechanical form of that mistake is `wrapper.vm.someRef`. Note that `$`-prefixed members are **not**
the same thing: `wrapper.vm.$nextTick()` and `wrapper.vm.$emit()` are Vue's public instance API and
are fine.

### Suite hygiene

These are the ways a suite goes wrong while every run stays green, so none of them announce themselves:

- **No `.only`.** A stray `describe.only` or `it.only` silently disables every other test in its file. The run stays green and the count drops by an amount nobody investigates
- **No test without an assertion.** A test that calls a function and asserts nothing passes even if that function becomes a no-op
- **No parked `.skip`.** A skipped test is a deferred fix living in the code — fix it or delete it, don't park it
- **No duplicate `describe`/`it` titles in a file.** That is a copy-paste that lost its edit: both run, neither fails, and the second one's intent is gone
- **No commented-out tests.** Deleting a test is fine; leaving it as a comment is a deletion without the honesty
- **`describe` for grouping, `it` for cases** — not `test`. Use `it.each()` for parametric cases and `beforeEach` to reset state between them

### Coverage

`npm run test:coverage` runs the suite through `@vitest/coverage-v8`. CI runs the same thing and
fails the build if any of the four metrics drops below the thresholds in `vitest.config.ts`
(currently **80%** for statements, branches, functions and lines).

- **The target is 100%.** 80 is the floor that fails the build today, not the goal. It ratchets up and never down — lowering a threshold to make a red build green is fixing the number that defines failure, not the failure
- **Coverage is written in the same PR as the change.** A coverage gap is a bug, not follow-up work
- **Branches is the honest metric.** Statements and lines happily skip over an unvisited `if` arm or a short-circuit that branches will catch
- **Coverage measures execution, not assertion quality.** A test that calls a function and asserts nothing still counts as covered. Treat the percentage as a floor, not a finish line

### There is no E2E suite

This is a decision, not a gap. Playwright currently has no officially supported Electron story — its Electron
API is experimental — and an attempt here ran into enough problems that it was
removed. Don't open a PR adding one back without raising it first.

The consequence is that **nothing tests the assembled app automatically.** Window creation, IPC
registration, the preload bridge and packaging all go unverified by CI, which is why running
`npm run dev` and clicking through your change is part of the PR checklist rather than a nicety.
Where a bug could only appear in the wired-up app, say so in the PR — a reviewer needs to know it was
checked by hand, because nothing else will check it.

## Code Style

This project uses **ESLint** (flat config) + **Prettier** for consistent formatting:

- **Prettier config** (`.prettierrc`): Single quotes, 4-space indent, 120 char line width, trailing commas, LF line endings
- **ESLint config** (`eslint.config.js`): TypeScript-aware rules + Vue plugin + Prettier integration
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase — look at similar files before writing new code
- Keep components small and focused — extract sub-components and composables when a file grows beyond ~300 lines
- Write clear, descriptive comments only where the logic isn't self-evident

## Releases

Leaf uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) — `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. The split is that
**humans decide, CI executes**.

| Bump      | When                                                                                | Example           |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| **MAJOR** | Breaking change for users — altered vault format, changed license, dropped platform | `1.4.2` → `2.0.0` |
| **MINOR** | New feature, backwards-compatible                                                   | `1.4.2` → `1.5.0` |
| **PATCH** | Bug fix, no new features, nothing breaking                                          | `1.4.2` → `1.4.3` |

Releases are batched, not automatic. The maintainer decides when one is worth cutting, then:

1. **Counts the commits since the last tag** to determine the bump — any `feat:` means at least a
   MINOR, `fix:` / `perf:` / `security:` alone means a PATCH, a breaking change means a MAJOR
   (which resets MINOR and PATCH to `0`)
2. **Lands one commit that does nothing but bump** — type `bump:`, updating `package.json`'s
   `"version"` field and nothing else:
    ```sh
    git commit -m "bump: version 2.7.0"
    ```

CI takes it from there. `release.yml` watches for a green CI run on `main`, reads the version out of
`package.json`, and stops if that tag already exists — so ordinary commits are a no-op and only the
bump commit triggers anything. When the version is new it tags the commit, builds the macOS and
Linux installers in parallel, and publishes them as a GitHub release.

Nothing about that is manual, which is why the bump commit has to be correct: it is the only human
input into the release.

## Reverting

Reverts are normal. A quick revert beats a scrambled hotfix — undo first, diagnose after.

```sh
git revert <sha>
```

Because everything is squash-merged, each PR is a single ordinary commit on `main`, so a plain
`git revert` undoes the whole thing. There are no merge commits to pick a mainline for.

Never `git reset --hard` on `main`. Revert forward — it leaves the history intact and reviewable.

Reverting the commit that shipped a release does **not** unpublish it: the tag, the release and any
installer already downloaded all still exist. Pull the GitHub release manually and ship a new patch
version.

## Reporting Issues

Use the [issue templates](https://github.com/larrydarko1/leaf/issues/new/choose) — they ask for the
version, OS and log location up front, which is most of what a bug report needs. Screenshots help.

**Security vulnerabilities do not go in issues.** Email the maintainer at <hello@larrydarko.dev>
instead; see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for scope and what to expect.
