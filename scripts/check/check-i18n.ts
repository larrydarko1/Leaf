 * i18n locale consistency gate. What it checks — plural, placeholder and array

 * @larrydarko/lint-config/gates/i18n; only this project's paths and the reasons
 * that are specific to it are here.
 *
 * assets/locales/*.json are not build artefacts: language.ts seeds them into
 * ~/.leaf/locales/ where users edit them, so `en` is both reference and fallback.
